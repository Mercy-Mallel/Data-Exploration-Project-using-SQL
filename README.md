# Data Exploration Project using SQL
In this personal project, I used a COVID-19 dataset from ourworldindata.org and tried to explore the data using SQL to analyze and gain insights into the data and prepare it for visualization.

## Data Collection
I used a Covid 19 dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). After downloading the data, I eliminated some irrelevant columns from the dataset using MS Excel and segregated the dataset into two portions, namely [CovidDeaths](https://github.com/Mercy-Mallel/Data-Exploration-Project-using-SQL/blob/main/Covid%2019%20Deaths%20Data.csv) and [CovidVaccinations](https://github.com/Mercy-Mallel/Data-Exploration-Project-using-SQL/blob/main/Covid%2019%20Vaccinations%20Data.csv).
The CovidDeaths dataset contained columns and records on cases and deaths while the CovidVaccinations dataset contains only columns and rows regarding vaccinations and tests. This whole SQL project was executed on the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

## Data Analysis
Since this is a data exploration project, there were no specific questions that needed to be answered. The goal was to get a feel of the data and see what patterns or trends, if any, could be seen, and compare stats amongst countries.
I was able to do the following and thus understand the data better;

+ Find the likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country 
+ Find the percentage of population infected with Covid in different countries and continents
+ Find the Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population
+ Find the Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
+ Find the contintents with the highest death count per population
+ Find the Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine
+ Created Views to store data for later visualizations
