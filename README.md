# Data Exploration Project using SQL
In this personal project, I used a COVID-19 dataset from ourworldindata.org and tried to explore the data using SQL to analyze and gain insights into the data and prepare it for visualization.

## Data Collection
I used a Covid 19 dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). After downloading the data, I eliminated some irrelevant columns from the dataset using MS Excel and segregated the dataset into two portions, namely [CovidDeaths](https://github.com/Mercy-Mallel/Data-Exploration-Project-using-SQL/blob/main/Covid%2019%20Deaths%20Data.csv) and [CovidVaccinations](https://github.com/Mercy-Mallel/Data-Exploration-Project-using-SQL/blob/main/Covid%2019%20Vaccinations%20Data.csv)
